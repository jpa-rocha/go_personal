I started this intership as the final part of my masters, and was part of unit dedicated to Mobility services.

The team where I was inserted was responsible for the topic parking, as Volkswagen Financial Services had the task of coordinating the implementation of 
of smart parking across the Volskagen Group brands.

Specifically my tasks where:  
    - Assisting with coordination of commissioned market study  
    - Expanding an existing competition analysis  
    - Market research to prepare market entry in Southern Europe (Portugal, Spain and Italy)
