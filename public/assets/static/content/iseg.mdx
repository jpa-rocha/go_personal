Looking for a change of topics I applied to the Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão, part of the Universidade de Lisboa.
The masters in Inustrial Strategy and Management had a broad focus on business themes, such as:
    - Marketing
    - Innovation Management
    - Logistics
    - Risk Analysis and Management

During this time, I started a business with my best friend, had children and moved to my current home in Germany.

When I finally finished my masters I did my dissertation following and internship at Volkswagen Financial Services on the topic: 
“Smart Parking - the Volkswagen Financial Services Case”, where I explored the different implementations of smart parking models 
in different countries in Europe.
