This internship is required as the final part of my studies at **[42 Wolfsburg](https://42wolfsburg.de/)**.

Here there have been 2 phases, one, working mostly with python and docker, with some tasks being:
    - Video analysis, streaming and recording using OpenCV
    - Backend implementations using FastAPI
    - Task scheduling using celery
    - Implementation of message brokers with RabbitMQ
    - Containerization of applications

The second:
    - GOLANG
    - Go decoders
    - Go web backend
    - Go GO GOOOO

This projct is ongoing, but these are the basic technologies I will be using here.
