Studied general psychology with the aim of studying clinical psychology.

During this time I was able to participate in the Erasmus Program, and lived in **[Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest)** for a year.
This brought me in contact with a lot of people from different cultures, and definetly had an impact on my worldview going forward.

Alas, during my internship and first professional setting, in a primary school in the outskirts of Lisbon, I came to realize that psychology and me weren't meant to be.
