I started my studies at 42 Wolfsburg, a programming school, as a way to add value to my skill set. The school is part of a larger **[42 Network](https://www.42network.org/)**, and is focused on peer-to-peer learning. The curriculum makes use of three programming languages, and has different projects, addressing different topics in increasing difficulty:  

C:
* Replications of basic built-in functions.
* Implementation of sorting algorithms.
* Use of graphical libraries to implement 3D games.
* Reverse engeneering of simple programs.

C++:
* Basics of Object Oriented programming.
* Implementations of a NGINX like web server.

TypeScript:
* Development of a fully functional **[website](https://github.com/jpa-rocha/master_of_pong)** using NestJS, React, PostgreSQL and Docker.
