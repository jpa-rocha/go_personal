During the pandemic and unable to find a job in my field, I started developing and interest in programming, not only as a pastime, 
but as a way to add value to my skill set.  

I started my studies at 42 Wolfsburg, a programming school, part of a larger **[42 Network](https://www.42network.org/)**, focused on peer-to-peer learning.  
The curriculum makes use of three programming languages, and has different projects, addressing different topics in increasing difficulty:  

C:  
    - Replications of basic built-in functions  
    - Implementation of sorting algorithms  
    - Use of graphical libraries to implement 3D games  
    - Reverse engeneering of simple programs  

C++:  
    - Basics of Object Oriented programming  
    - Implementations of a NGINX like web server  

TypeScript:  
    - Development of a fully functional **[website](https://github.com/jpa-rocha/master_of_pong)** using NestJS, React, PostgreSQL and Docker (a 42 id is needed to be able to access the site unfortunatelly)
