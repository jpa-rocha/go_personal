This position was started as an internship as required for the final part of my studies at **[42 Wolfsburg](https://42wolfsburg.de/)**, but has been extended into a normal contract.
Here there have been 2 phases, one, working mostly with python and docker, with some tasks being:

* Video analysis, streaming and recording using OpenCV
* Backend implementations using FastAPI
* Task scheduling using celery
* Implementation of message brokers with RabbitMQ
* Containerization of applications

The second and currently my main area of focus:
* Golang
* Go decoders
* Go web backend (HTMX frontend)

This projct is ongoing, but these are the basic technologies I will be using here.
