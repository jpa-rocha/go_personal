Started the company with my best friend Nuno, we did electric bycicle tours of Lisbon, for private customers and companies.  
It was a great experience, to be able to spend a lot of time outside, in good company.

There were valuable lessons not only on interacting with different types of customers, from different cultures, but also 
it was a great way to work on presentation skills, as each tour followed a route, and customers needed to be informed and entertained, 
and although there can be a framework for what is presented, every tour needed to be customized on the spot.

In late 2015, when my first child was born, sadly, I left Nuno and moved to Germany.  
If you are ever in Lisbon [contact](https://www.lisboncycletours.com/) Nuno, and he will show you a good time.
